## Analysis Overview
My boss, W.Avy a super chill surfer dude wants to open up a surf and ice cream shop to spread joy and good vibes on the island! However W.Avy also understands that weather is a critical factor in determining what the daily swell and scoop numbers will look like. In order to better understand the vibes and energy of Oahu, W.Avy felt that gathering temperture data from June to December would provide a most radical insight as to whether or not it is a good idea to open an ice cream/ surf shop that operates year round.

* Average temp in June is just below 75 degrees on Oahu while the average temp in December is right around 71 degrees.
* The minimum temp in December is 8 degrees less (56 F) compared to June (64 F). 
* The maximum temp in June is only 2 degrees warmer (85 F) compared to December (83 F)

## Summary
Looking at this data it becomes apparent that the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures are fairly close to one another. This means that tempertures on Oahu are relativley stable year round, we get no where near freezing temperatures and the max tempertures aren't even that hot or far off from the min temps we see in the data. This indicates to me that W.Avy's idea of opening a year surf/ ice cream shop is rad, and customers would most likley be visiting W.Avy's **"Swells & Scoops Store"** on a regular basis (consistent weather = consitent customers). 

### Additional Queries
1) What do the temperature trends look like over the past few years? Would it be possible to use historical weather data to create a future forecast of what tempertaures will look like in the coming years? Sure the **"Swells & Scoops Store"** may have a good positive business outlook this year but what about next year and five years down the road. Most small businesses do not turn a profit the first year. Knowing if the business will be sustainble in the long run may be a better way of determining if opening this business is a good plan or not. 
2) Temperature doesn't show us the whole pciture! People might go surfing when it is raining, but they might not go out for ice cream when it's raining. It would be useful to know how many days of the years it is sunny, overcast, raining, or perhaps monsooning. Rainy days won't make good opportunities for selling ice cream even though there may be surfers out on the water.
