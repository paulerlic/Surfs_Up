## Analysis Overview
My boss, W.Avy wants to understand the temperature trends on Oahu before opening up his surf and ice cream shop year round. To best understand the weather, he felt that gathering data from June and December would be the most indicative of the temperature fluctuations on the island and give him the most information on whether or not to open up his shop.

* The average temperature in June is just shy of 75 degrees on Oahu while the average temperature in December is approximately 71 degrees.
* The minimum temperature in December is 8 degrees colder (56 F) than it is in June (64 F)
* The maximum temperature in June is only 2 degrees warmer (85 F) than it is in December (83 F)

## Summary
I think this data would indicate to W.Avy that he'd be able to keep his surf and ice cream shop open year round. The minimum, maximum, and average temperatures are all relatively close to each other. They all also point to the fact that it would be warm enough year round for customers to go surfing and eat ice cream. 

### Additional Queries
1) I would like to see how these temperatures have been trending in June and December over the past couple of years --> for example, is it getting warmer/colder on average in these months?
2) Temperature doesn't tell the whole story! I want to know how many days it has been sunny, overcast, raining, snowing, etc. during these months. Rainy days won't make for good surfing or ice cream sale opportunities.
